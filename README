This process takes output from BUY_PROCESS/BUY_PROC_ACTION, along with some embedded code, and writes a series of rules.

1.  Query these tables with buyrules.jcl; output = <HLQ>.PROCESS
2.  Download and clean previous output with getCleanBuy.sh; output = process.cleaned
3.  Execute main.cpp, which does the following:
    a.  load process.cleaned into a mySql table = buy_process


Change

like logic, to include ric d
static rules
ricb rules
consider sequence - resolve conflicts
deconstructor remove connection
